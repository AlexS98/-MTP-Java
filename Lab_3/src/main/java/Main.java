/*
 * Variant 4
 * Create an array of numbers that consists of 150 elements. The contents of the array generate with Random#nextInt.
 * Implement five types of data sorts: bubble sort, cocktail sort, quick sort, cycle sort, odd-even sort;
 * Use two libraries to sort the data.
 * Three times perform each of the sorts, including sorts with libraries, with the working time measurement of each of them.
 * Gather the performance (resources and time) metrics of your sorting and libraries sorting.
 * The time for working of the each sort is output to the console.
